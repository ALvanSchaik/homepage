Project description:
In this project I made a website for the 'Homepage' assignment. It's a (really bad) website for an architect firm. For this I've used content from my sister's site http://www.baltussenvanschaik.nl/ with her permission. 

Files:
index.html
    The homepage of the website
projecten.html
    A page of the website that showcases one of the projects.
publicaties.html
    A page that showcases on of the publications.
bureau.html
    A page with a list about html and a useless button where you can pretend to like and subscribe.
styles.css
    The stylesheet used for the site.
styles.scss
    The SCSS file that was used to make the style sheet, included for reference.
README.md
    File containing project and file descriptions
